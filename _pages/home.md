This site contains a loose collection of technical articles, ramblings and
know-how that I think might be worth to be shared with the general public.

The content to be found here is mainly focusing on topics such as Kubernetes,
GitOps and developing software, but might contain something completely
different from time to time as well.

All information is provided as-is, I take no liability if your mileage varies.
If you find something that you think needs correction, please let me know or
even better, open a pull request at this site's
[repository](https://github.com/mistrust-networks/mistrust-web).
